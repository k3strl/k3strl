# Hi there! 👋🏻 I'm Nic Blaize! I'm finally fulfilling my dreams of becoming a full-stack web developer.

- 🔭 I’m  enrolled in a BCS coding bootcamp through the University of Minnesota. It's tough but I'm learning quickly!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React, Postgres, Javascript/Typescript, MongoDB, Python, and much more
- 🤓 I'm interested in all kinds of stuff and my interests change frequently. Lately I've been digging into Linux distros and sysadmin stuff, with the intent to build my own homelab.
- 😄 Pronouns: they/them & he/him
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at i(dot)k3strl at gmail
- ⚡ Fun fact: octopuses have 3 hearts, and 1 stops beating when they swim! 🐙
