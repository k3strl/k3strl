# Hi there! 👋🏻 I'm Nic, a full-stack web developer.

- 🔭 I’m  enrolled in the edX coding bootcamp through the University of Minnesota. It's tough and fast-paced, but I'm learning quickly!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React, Postgres, Javascript/Typescript, MongoDB, Python, and much more
- 🤓 My interests are widely varied, and include plants, animals, and crafting. Lately, I've been digging into Raspberry Pis, Linux distros, and sysadmin stuff, and planning my first homelab.
- 📫 How to reach me: comment, message, or email me.
- ⚡ Fun fact: octopuses have 3 hearts, and 1 stops beating when they swim! 🐙
